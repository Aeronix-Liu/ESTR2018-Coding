# ESTR2018-Coding
This repository includes our experiment and visualization code.
Running softmax_visualization.py gives figure 1 and 2 in our essay.
Running softmax_lse_entropy.m in MATLAB gives 3D visulization of lse and negative entropy function
Running softmax_experiment_more.py in pytorch gives training curves, probability distribution and misclassified examples.
